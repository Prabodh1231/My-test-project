    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>A creamy tomato soup is typically the result of, well, stirring in heavy cream. 
        But in this vegan version, bread gives the soup its silky-smooth texture. 
        Here's how it works: French bread is soaked in rice or almond milk before getting pureed with a cooked tomato mixture flavored with onion, garlic, and oregano. 
        The vinegar stirred in at the end adds brightness and balance. Serve in bowls garnished with more fresh oregano, a drizzle of olive oil, and freshly-ground black pepper—and the remainder of the French bread on the side. 
        Keep this recipe handy, because you'll want to keep it in rotation all soup-season long. </p>
