   <P><em>Shiitake mushrooms, when roasted, take on an umami goodness close to that of crispy bacon. 
    Make sure the mushrooms aren't piled on top of each other on the sheet tray so they can get crispy—otherwise they'll steam. 
    This brings maximum bacon-like flavor and texture into this vegetarian BLT. 
    Make our easy mayo from scratch and spread a thin layer on whole-wheat bread, bonus points if it's seeded. 
    Head to the store and pick up some gorgeous in-season tomatoes for bite after bite of delicious simplicity. </em></P>
    <p>This recipe takes about 30-35 min in for 2 serving</p>
